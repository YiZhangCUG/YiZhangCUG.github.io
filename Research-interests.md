## Density structures of the lithosphere and upper mantle derived from multiple data sets
Earthâ€™s lithosphere and upper mantle are the most outer layers of the planet, which present much stronger heterogeneities comparing to the inner layers. Studies on these objects help us understanding the tectonic characteristics of the lithosphere and dynamic processes undergoing in the underneath asthenosphere. Considering the limitations of individual geophysical disciplines, I interest in the integration of multiple geophysical data sets, including seismic velocities, gravity, thermal and chemical states et. al., to recover the physical properties, such as the density structures, of the outer layers of the Earth. Subsequently, tectonic features and geodynamic properties could be deduced from such results.

## Numerical modeling and inverse geodynamics of the asthenosphere
Sitting in between the rigid lithosphere and more flexible mantle, the asthenosphere plays an important role in the transformation of different mineral phases, thermal conditions and chemical properties between the deep interior of Earth and its outer parts. Through forward and inverse approaches. We could construct self-consistent models regarding the thermal and chemical states of the asthenosphere. In addition, the interaction between the asthenosphere and the lithosphere. Furthermore, the geodynamic influences on the deformation of the lithosphere and other plate tectonic features.

## Gravity field of terrestrial planets and its applications on the planetary interior
Given the development of our space technologies, the gravity field gives us one of the best chances to investigate other terrestrial planets in our solar system. Most of them experienced very different geological evolutions comparing to Earth. Moreover, distinct features are observed from their gravity fields. Combined with other available techniques, some of their interior physical properties could be obtained. Additionally, insights of the early stage of Earth might be given. I am particularly interested in those findings derived from their gravity data and the corresponding techniques, and some day in the further, from the time varying gravity field.

## Machine learning in the inversion of geophysical data
The inversion of the geophysical data is usually solved by an iteration process. For large scale problems, this process is normally time consuming, and the inverted geophysical properties cannot be easily reviewed until the process terminates. Having multiple factors that could alter the outcome, the final result is more likely achieved through trial-and-error adjustment of the conditions. Meanwhile, large number of intermediate products of the iteration process have been overlooked in our current studies. I wonder, by introducing machine learning techniques into the process of inversion to study the properties of the intermediate products, whether a better understanding of the problem or superior methods could be achieved, and how should we do that.
