Compile
----------------
For Mac OS users, install gcc using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by

```bash
brew install gcc
```

For Linux users, install gcc by

```bash
apt-get install gcc
```

then go the directory of the program and ``make`` the program. Then export the directory to your $PATH.

Usage
----------------

```bash
grav2d-cube -r<x-start>/<x-step>/<x-end>/<y-start>/<y-step>/<y-end>/<elevation>|<filename> -c<x-cen>/<y-cen>/<z-cen>/<dx>/<dy>/<dz>/<density>|<filename> -tgravity|gx|gy|gz -h > out-file
```

Options
----------------
+ __-r__: Initializing the observation points from parameters or a file. If the parameters are used, you need to specify starting and ending positions of *x* and *y* coordinates of the observation points, along with their intervals *dx* and *dy*. The interval could be a positive or negative number depending on whether the starting coordinate is bigger than the ending coordinate or not. The program could also read observation's positions from a file, in which each line of the file contains the *x*, *y* and *z* coordinates of a observation point. Any line that starts with '#' will be ignored so that you can annotate the file as you want. Note that the program uses the right-hand system for the observation points, which means the *x* and *y* directions correspond to the easting and northing directions, respectively. 
+ __-c__: Initializing geometric and physical properties of a cube from parameters or cubes from a file. The geometric properties of a cube is represented by its center location *\<x-cen\>/\<y-cen\>/\<z-cen\>* and spatial extensions *\<dx\>/\<dy\>/\<dz\>*. the cube's density is appended last to the parameter string. A file that contains parameter strings is needed if you want to add multiple cubes. Each line of the file describes one cube. Also, any line that starts with '#' will be ignored. Note that the program uses the reversed right-hand system for locating the cubes, in which case the *z* direction is pointing downward, and the *x* and *y* directions correspond to the northing and easting directions, respectively. 
+ __-t__: Choose the component of the forward calculation, which is *gravity* for gravity and *gx, gy* and *gz* gravity gradient in *x, y* and *z* directions, respectively.
+ __out-file__: Output file of the forward calculated gravitational data. The program will use the standard output by default. However, you can redirect the output to a file by using the '>' symbol. Each line of output file consists of *x y z* positions of the observation point and the forward calculation gravitational data appended at the last.
+ __-h__: Show help information.
